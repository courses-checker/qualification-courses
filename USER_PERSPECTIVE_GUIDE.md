# 🎓 KUCCPS COURSES CHECKER - USER PERSPECTIVE GUIDE

**What You See & What You Can Do**

---

## 📱 WHAT IS THIS PLATFORM?

**In Simple Terms:**

KUCCPS Courses Checker is a **free online tool** that helps Kenyan high school graduates (like you!) find university, college, and vocational courses that match their KCSE grades.

**Think of it like this:**
- You enter your KCSE grades once
- The tool instantly shows you ALL the courses you qualify for  
- You can compare programs, save favorites, and plan your future

**This is NOT:**
- The official KUCCPS portal (that's www.kuccps.net for actual applications)
- An admission guarantee (you still need to apply through KUCCPS)
- A charged service for basic browsing (though some premium features cost KES 200-100)

**Who Should Use This?**
✅ High school graduates with KCSE results  
✅ Students unsure which courses match their grades  
✅ Parents helping students plan post-secondary education  
✅ Anyone exploring their educational options in Kenya

## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS STUDENTS ASK

### **Q1: Is this official KUCCPS?**
**A:** No. This is an **unofficial independent tool** to help you understand courses BEFORE applying to official KUCCPS. The real application happens at www.kuccps.net.

### **Q2: Will paying KES 200 guarantee me admission?**
**A:** No. The fee only shows you which courses you qualify for. Actual admission depends on:
1. Your application to KUCCPS
2. Your cluster points vs. the university's requirements
3. Availability (some programs get filled quickly)
4. KUCCPS official placement process

### **Q3: Do I have to restart if I make a mistake entering grades?**
**A:** Yes. If you entered a grade wrong, you'd need to:
- Click "Try Again"
- Re-enter correct grades
- Pay again for that category

*Tip: Double-check your grades before paying!*

### **Q4: Can I check multiple course categories on one payment?**
**A:** No. Each category is separate:
- First category: KES 200
- Each additional: KES 100
- So checking 3 categories = KES 200 + 100 + 100 = KES 400 total

### **Q5: Is my email information safe?**
**A:** Your email is used only for session tracking. Serious privacy measures are in place (HTTPS encryption, not shared with third parties).

### **Q6: What if M-Pesa payment fails?**
**A:** You'll see an error message and can retry. Money is only deducted if payment succeeds and is confirmed.

### **Q7: How long are results available?**
**A:** 30 minutes of active browsing. After 30 minutes idle, session expires. You can restart anytime with same email + index.

### **Q8: Can I share my partner's results?**
**A:** You can share their **email + index number form** so they can run their own check. Each person pays for their own session.

### **Q9: Is there an app? Or just website?**
**A:** Website only (so far). Works great on phones, tablets, desktops. You can "install" to home screen on some phones (PWA feature).

### **Q10: What if I forgot my KCSE index number?**
**A:** Check your:
- KCSE certificate (printed)
- KNEC portal account (if registered)
- School records
- Contact exam officer at your school

## 🌟 WHY THIS PLATFORM EXISTS

**The Problem It Solves:**

Before this tool, students had to:
- ❌ Manually search each institution's website separately
- ❌ Guess if they qualify for a program (unsure what cut-offs meant)

- ❌ Spend hours researching without a clear picture
- ❌ Make blind applications without knowing realistic options

**What This Tool Does:**

✅ **Instant Matching** – See all 5000+ courses you qualify for in 5 minutes  
✅ **Clarity on Requirements** – Know exactly what grades/points needed  
✅ **Saves Time** – No hours of manual research needed  
✅ **Builds Confidence** – Know your realistic options  
✅ **Affordable** – Just KES 200-100, pays for itself in saved time  
✅ **Accessible** – Works on any phone with internet (no app needed)  
✅ **Support 24/7** – AI chat always available if confused
